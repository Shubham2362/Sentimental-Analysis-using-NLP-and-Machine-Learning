# Unravel Twitter Sentimental Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the Unravel Twitter Sentimental Analysis project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the emotional tone behind a series of words and is commonly used to understand social sentiment in tweets.

## Features
- Data Collection: Scripts to collect and preprocess Twitter data.
- Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning and normalization.
- Feature Extraction: Transform text data into features using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
- Model Training: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, for advanced neural network models)

## Installation
### Steps :
### 1. Downloading the Repository
You have two main options to download the repository: direct download or cloning using Git.

*Option 1*: Direct Download
Navigate to the GitHub repository you are interested in.

Click on the green "Code" button.

Select "Download ZIP".

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory on your computer.

*Option 2*: Cloning the Repository (Requires Git)
Open a terminal (command prompt or Git Bash).
Clone the repository using the following command:
    
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

Replace your-username and repository-name with the appropriate values from the repository URL.

### 2. Setting Up Your Environment
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. If not, you can install it via pip:

    pip install jupyterlab

Or, if you prefer Jupyter Notebook:

    pip install notebook

### 3. Downloading Datasets from the Repository
Datasets are usually stored in a directory within the repository (e.g., data/).

- If you downloaded the ZIP file, the datasets will be included in the extracted directory.
- If you cloned the repository, the datasets will also be included in the cloned directory.

### 4. Running the Jupyter Notebook
1.Navigate to the directory where you downloaded or cloned the repository.

    cd path/to/repository

Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
or

    jupyter lab

2.In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the directory containing the .ipynb file.

3.Click on the notebook file to open it.

### 5. Installing Required Packages
Notebooks often require specific Python packages. These are usually listed in a requirements.txt file or within the first cells of the notebook.

Installing Packages from the Notebook
Sometimes, the necessary packages are specified in the notebook itself.For example:
    
    !pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

### 6. Running the Notebook
Once all required packages are installed, you can run the cells in the notebook:

1.Click on the first cell.

2.Press Shift + Enter to run the cell and move to the next one, or use the "Run" button in the toolbar.
